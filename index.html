<div><h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Layne Stephens and I am a student at the University of Michigan. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in UI/UX Design. I have a lot of school spirit and love going to the football games with my friends!</p>

    <p>In my free time, I like to read, watch movies, and crochet. I prefer staying indoors, but I also love spending time with my friends and family. So, I can be convinced to go on a camping trip or a hike now and again.</p>
